## Introduction
This is a well-known game named **Gomoku** or **Gobang**. The winner is the player who can firstly form an unbroken chain of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. It's also known as **five in a row**.

The website is used to practice my newly learnt **React.js** skill when I just finished the course about basics of React.js from Lidemy Mentor Program.
